  {
    q: "What is an ATM Franchise in India?",
    a: "An ATM franchise in India operates under the White Label ATM (WLA) model regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). A franchise partner provides commercial space and capital, while the licensed operator (such as Hitachi, EPS, Findi, or India1) manages switching, banking integration, compliance, and technical monitoring. The franchise partner earns commission on every successful transaction."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a Bank ATM and a White Label ATM (WLA)?",
    a: "A Bank ATM is owned by a specific bank (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, etc.) and primarily supports its own customers. A White Label ATM (WLA) is operated by RBI-licensed non-bank companies and serves customers of all banks. WLA machines generate interchange-based income shared with the franchise partner."
  },
  {
    q: "How does an ATM franchise generate monthly income?",
    a: "ATM franchise income is transaction-based. Revenue is generated from interchange fees paid when customers withdraw cash or perform non-financial transactions. Higher daily transaction volume directly increases monthly profit. Income depends primarily on location quality and competition density."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the average monthly income from an ATM franchise in 2026?",
    a: "Monthly income depends on daily transactions. An ATM averaging 110–150 transactions per day can generate ₹30,000–₹50,000 net per month after operational costs. High-demand locations such as transport hubs, wholesale markets, and residential banking deserts may exceed this range."
  },
  {
    q: "How much investment is required to start an ATM franchise in India?",
    a: "The typical ATM franchise investment in India ranges between ₹3–6 lakh. This includes refundable security deposit (₹1–3 lakh) and working capital for cash loading (₹2–3 lakh). Exact capital requirement depends on operator model and city category."
  },
  {
    q: "Is ATM franchise business safe and RBI regulated?",
    a: "Yes. White Label ATM operators function under RBI guidelines and NPCI network standards. Settlement cycles, interchange structures, and compliance rules are standardized. However, profitability depends on location selection and transaction volume."
  },
  {
    q: "What documents are required for ATM franchise approval?",
    a: "Common documents include Aadhaar card, PAN card, active bank account details, property ownership proof or registered lease agreement, and landlord NOC (if rented). Operators also conduct physical site verification before approval."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to start an ATM franchise?",
    a: "After document verification and site approval, installation and activation typically take 15–30 days. Timelines vary depending on operator processing and site feasibility."
  },
  {
    q: "Who handles cash loading and maintenance?",
    a: "In the managed model, authorized Cash Replenishment Agencies (CRAs) handle cash loading and maintenance. In the self-loading model, the franchise partner loads cash and may earn a higher commission margin. Technical monitoring operates 24×7 through centralized systems."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I install an ATM in a rented shop?",
    a: "Yes. An ATM can be installed in a rented commercial property with a valid lease agreement and landlord NOC. The site must meet operator criteria including 50–80 sq ft space, 24×7 accessibility, stable electricity, and strong road visibility."
  },
  {
    q: "What are the biggest risks in ATM franchise business?",
    a: "The primary risks are poor location selection, low daily transactions (below 80 per day), high competition density, and operational downtime. ATM franchise profitability is volume-driven, not fixed-income guaranteed."
  },
  {
    q: "Is ATM franchise fully passive income?",
    a: "ATM franchise generates semi-passive income but requires monitoring. Uptime discipline, cash cycle management, and periodic performance review are essential for stable monthly income."
